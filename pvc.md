Great! You're planning to **enhance PVC - Public Viewing Cinema** with a **web-based UI** and **server-side integration using Python Flask**, targeting an Indian audience with **₹ (Rupees)** as the currency and localized units.

Here's an updated **project synopsis** considering your new direction:

---

### 🎬 **PVC - Public Viewing Cinema**
**Movie Ticket Booking System (Web-Based Edition)**  
**Tech Stack**: Python, Flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, CSV-based storage (or SQLite)

---

### 🔧 **System Overview**
PVC is a **web-based movie booking system** tailored for Indian cinema-goers. Built with **Python Flask** for the backend, it offers an intuitive **browser-based interface** for users and admins, replacing the CLI system.

### 👥 **User Roles & Access**

| User Type        | Role Description                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎟️ **Users**         | Register, log in, browse movies, and book tickets                              |
| 🏢 **Theatre Admins** | Manage movies for their assigned theatres and view related bookings            |
| 🛡️ **System Admin**   | View system-wide stats, bookings, and manage movie data globally               |

### 🌐 **Web Features**

#### 👤 **User Panel**
- **Signup/Login** with email and password
- **Browse Movies** across multiple theatres with filters (genre, time, theatre)
- **Book Tickets** with dynamic seat availability
- **Booking History** with date/time and total cost in **₹ Rupees**

- **Booking Logs**: View all bookings across theatres

---

### 💸 **Revenue Logic**
- Ticket cost assumed as **₹150 per seat**
- Total revenue calculated as:
  ```
  Total Revenue = Total Seats Booked × ₹150
  ```

---

### 📂 **Data Storage**
- Initial version uses **CSV files** (users.csv, movies.csv, bookings.csv, etc.)
- Optionally upgradable to **SQLite** or **MySQL** for production use
- Data flow is handled using Flask models or raw file parsing

---

### 🧩 **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Bootstrap 5, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python Flask (with `flask_login` for session handling)
- **Templating**: Jinja2 templates
- **Storage**: CSV files or SQLite DB
- **Deployment**: Localhost or Cloud (e.g., PythonAnywhere, Render, AWS EC2)

### 📱 **User Journey Example (Web UI)**
1. User signs up on `/register` → logs in via `/login`
2. Homepage shows movie listings with details:
   ```
   Avatar 2 - Sci-Fi | INOX, Bengaluru | 7:30 PM | ₹150 | 48 Seats Left
   ```
3. On clicking "Book", a form lets the user choose the number of seats
4. Upon booking, a confirmation page shows:
   - Movie name
   - Seats booked
   - Total amount in **Rupees (₹)**
   - Theatre details and showtime
5. Users can access `/my-bookings` to view their history

### ✅ **Next Steps**
To transition from CLI to Flask-based web UI:
1. **Set up Flask Project Structure**
2. Create Blueprints for each user type (`user`, `admin`, `theatre`)
3. Convert CLI functions to Flask routes
4. Replace `input()` calls with HTML forms
5. Implement session-based login with `flask_login` or `Flask-Session`
6. Build frontend with Bootstrap or any UI kit
